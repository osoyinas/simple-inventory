This desktop application utilizes Vite, Electron, React, TypeScript, and tailwindcss to manage the inventory of a warehouse. It allows storing information about individuals, materials, projects, or jobs, as well as tracking transactions that describe when an individual withdraws a material, the quantity withdrawn, and the project to which it is allocated.
